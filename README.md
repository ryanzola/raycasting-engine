# Raycasting Engine

I will be attempting to implement a traditional raycasting engine in C, using the SDL2 library. Raycasting is a popular technique used in 2D game engines to create a pseudo-3D environment, and it's most famously known for its use in the classic game "Wolfenstein 3D". I embarked on this project as an academic exercise to learn more about raycasting and bring back some of the enjoyment I had while playing iconic games like Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, and Duke Nukem 3D during my childhood. This project aims to showcase the fundamentals of raycasting engines and their role in the history of game development, while also revisiting the fun of these classic titles.

## Features

- Written in C for optimal performance and low-level control
- Utilizes the SDL2 library for cross-platform compatibility
- Efficient raycasting algorithm to create pseudo-3D environments
- Textured walls and floors for a more immersive experience
- Basic collision detection and movement controls

## Getting Started

To get started with the boilerplate, follow these steps:

1 Clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ryanzola/raycasting-engine.git
cd sdl-game-loop-boilerplate
```

2 Ensure that you have SDL2 installed on your system. If not, follow the instructions in the video or refer to the official SDL documentation for installation guidance.

3 Utilize the provided Makefile to build, run, and clean the project:

- Build the project:

```bash
make build
```

- Run the project:

```bash
make run
```

- Clean the project (remove the compiled binary):

```bash
make clean
```
